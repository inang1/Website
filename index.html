    <big><strong>Hello!! My name is Isabella Nang, and it's nice to meet you!</big></strong>

    <br>
    <br>

    I received a B.S. in Mathematics from Georgia State University along with an M.S. in Computational Science and Engineering from Georgia Tech. I currently work at Demand Driven Technologies as a business data analyst, assisting in the creation of an AI/machine learning model to help our customers' supply chain by minimizing inventory while maximizing their on time delivery.

    <br>

    In October 2021, I was diagnosed with a rare bone cancer called <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15041-osteosarcoma">osteosarcoma</a>.

    <br>
    <br>

    After 5 surgeries and 30 weeks of chemotherapy over the course of a year, I was declared NED (No Evidence of Disease) and have been since October 2022. I hope to one day use my data analysis skills to help predict recurrence in other osteosarcoma patients.

  <a href="https://github.com/inang1/Twitch-Tracker-Scraper"><h2> Twitch Tracker Scraper </h2></a>
  <p>
    A webscraper built in Python using Selenium to crawl a particular streamer's Twitch Tracker page and export their stream data. The only inputs needed are the Twitch ID of the streamer along with the export path for the csv.
    <br>
    <br>
    The csv data export contains the following columns: Date of Stream, Time of Stream, Duration, Average Concurrent Viewers, Max Concurrent Viewers, Followers, Views, and Title.
  </p>

  <a href="https://github.com/inang1/Twitch-Tracker-Viz"><h2> Twitch Tracker Visualizations (WIP)</h2></a>
  <p>
    Included in this repo are recreations of the Statistics page on Twitch Tracker, all made using the csv export from my Twitch Tracker Scraper. Two versions of the visualizations are included: one made using matplotlib/seaborn with Python and a visual made with PowerBI.

    <br>
    <br>

    The visualizations include the following:
    <br>
    <br>
    1. Day of the Week Analysis: Number of Active Days, Number of Active Days by Year, Hours Streamed on Average, Average Number of Viewers, Average number of Followers
    <br>
    <br>
    2. Statistics by Month: Hours Streamed, Concurrent Viewers, Followers Gained
    <br>
    <br>
    3. A visualization combining total followers, total views, hours streamed, hours watched, average viewers, and active days.

    <br>
    <br>

    The Python version also includes functions to pull the following statistics and display them as a table: followers to date, views to date, average stream time, total hours streamed, active days per week, followers per stream, views per stream, average followers gained per hour streamed, and average views per hour streamed. It also can generate a wordcloud of the most common words used in the stream titles.

  <a href="https://github.com/inang1/DDMRP-Simulator"><h2> DDMRP Simulator (WIP)</h2></a>
  <p>
    A DDMRP simulation tool built in Python that takes in a Parts file and Demand History file, cleans and combines them, then simulates the demand history and outputs a results file. Visualizations of the Green/Yellow/Red zones for each part is included with each image having the name of the corresponding part.

    <br>
    <br>

    When I first started working for Demand Driven Technologies, I would format the data in Excel to match the AI/ML tool format, run it through the AI/ML software multiple times using different settings, format the original data to match a different DDMRP simulation tool within Excel, then combine the different outputs of the AI/ML software and Excel simulation into a results file. All of this was done manually and was very time consuming.

    <br>
    <br>

    This script automates the process by formatting the client data to the requirements of the AI/ML tool, takes the AI/ML formatted data and runs simulations (removing the need to reformat the data and run it within the Excel simulation tool), then takes the results and outputs them as xlsx files from the tool and combines them for easy comparison. Visualizations of the Green/Yellow/Red zones for each part is available in a separate output folder.
