    <big><strong>Hello!! My name is Isabella Nang, and it's nice to meet you!</big></strong>

    <br>
    <br>

    I received a B.S. in Mathematics from Georgia State University along with an M.S. in Computational Science and Engineering from Georgia Tech. I currently work at Demand Driven Technologies as a business data analyst, assisting in the creation of an AI/machine learning model to help our customers' supply chain by minimizing inventory while maximizing their on time delivery.

    For my full education and work history, please refer to my <a href="Resume.pdf">resume</a>.

    <br>
    <br>

    In October 2021, I was diagnosed with a rare bone cancer called <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15041-osteosarcoma">osteosarcoma</a>.

    <br>
    <br>

    After 5 surgeries and 30 weeks of chemotherapy over the course of a year, I was declared NED (No Evidence of Disease) and have been since October 2022. I hope to one day use my data analysis skills to help predict recurrence in other osteosarcoma patients.

    A webscraper built in Python using Selenium to crawl a particular streamer's Twitch Tracker page and export their stream data. The only inputs needed are the Twitch ID of the streamer along with the export path for the csv.
